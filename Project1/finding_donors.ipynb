    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "For this problem we have chosen logistic regression, SVM and adaboost supervised learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is mainly used in machine learning algorithms where have to predict the output based on the input data like weather predictions: Stormy, sunny, cloudy, rainy etc\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strengths:\n",
    "Very easy and widely used, fast in training and testing time, it not only gives a measure of how relevant a predictor is coefficient size) but also its direction of association (positive or negative), works very well with lesser number of features\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weaknesses: \n",
    "It doesn't work well if too many feature variables are available, Need to be linear seperable, can't predict continuous outcome (it can not be used to determine how high patient's fever will rise, because the scale of measurement temperature is continuous)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It works well for our dataset because its a binary classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It can be used in face detection, handwriting recognition, classification of images and many more\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strengths: \n",
    "It works well with high dimensional problems, is useful for both Linearly Seperable(hard margin) and Non-linearly Seperable(soft margin) data, different kernals can be used according to different problems\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weaknesses:\n",
    "It doesn't work well with large datasets, sometimes difficult to find an appropriate kernel function to solve nonlinear problems\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Works well with our dataset but slowest of all three chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real world application of adaboost is object detection in an image. Ex is the identification of players in basket ball game\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strengths:\n",
    "It has high accuracy, fits well, fast in training and testing, it can be used to boost the performance of any machine learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weaknesses:\n",
    "It is sensitive to outliers and noisy data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. As the dataset is clean, doesn't contain any outlier and missing value and the size of the dataset is good enough to perform multiple training iterations to improve accuracy and f-score of the testing data\n",

    "Based on the above analysis, it is clear that adaboost classification method is most appropriate for identifying individuals that make more than 50000 because of the following reasons:\n",
    "1. F score and accuracy are highest in case of adaboost for testing dataset if we take 100% (or any percentage) of the training dataset. \n",
    "2. Model training/prediction time is almost negligible in case of adaboost if we compare it with svc.\n",
    "3. Adaboost provided robust performance on the testing set compared to the other two models. As we are interested in predicting those who makes more than 50000 accurately so highest accuracy model i.e adaboost is a good choice here. Also the training time for the adaboost model was little slower than the logistic regression model but its accuracy is high compared to logistic regression so I think we should choose accuracy over speed."

    "\n",
    "Let’s say I need to make a list of all my colleagues who are taller than 5’5″, weigh less than 160 lbs, and are between the ages of 28 and 41. I can't use any machine for this, All I am allowed to do is to take a look at the person and make a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say I am not good at estimating these parameters just by looking at my colleague. So to improve the accuracy, I ask three of my friends to help me out. One of my friends is really good at guessing the height, second one is really good at guessing the weight and the third one is really good at guessing the age. Individually, they may not be all that useful to me, because they are good at only one task. But if I combine them together and filter out all the people, I have a very good chance of getting an accurate list of people who qualify. This is the concept behind AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets move on to decision trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "decision tree can be seen as a set of rules which contains simple clauses (e.g if age > 4 and age < 5 and weight < 10kg then child_is = underweighted). The rules can be easily understood and can provide intuitions which are not always obvious by a simple inspection of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost revisited:\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all we fit our first weak learner (Decision Tree) in order to maximize accuracy or minimize number of errors. We can't get all the points fitted correctly so suppose we are left with few misclassified points. This is our first model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next our second learner will try to fix the errors which first learner made, so it will take the misclassified points and make them bigger meaning it will punish the model more if it misses these points so our second learner will focus on these errors more and will try to correctly classify these points. This is our second model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our third week learner will focus on the misclassified points by our second model by enlarging them even more and will classify them and this is our third model.\n",
    "\n",
    "we can keep going until points can't be classified further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here in this project: \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the weak learners (decision trees) are created taking various features given(age, workclass, education etc) and they predict based on these features how much an individual earns. \n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above during the training process each weak learner will look at the previous models and will try to fix the misclassified points (here income). This process will go on untill we can't improve the model furthur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost then combines all the weak learners/models and creates an ensemble of models where these models vote to predict that whether an individual earns above 50K or not accordingly and will donate to the charity or not.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
